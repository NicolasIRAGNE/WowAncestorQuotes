# WowAncestorQuotes
World of Warcraft addon to play Darkest Dungeon narrator quotes when appropriate.

Sound files are property of Red Hook Studios and were downloaded from the [wiki](https://darkestdungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Narrator).

This is a very early draft that was written mostly to learn how to make addons. More quotes / features will be added as time goes on.

NB: This addon only works with the enUS version of WoW. I could not for the life of me figure out how to use spellIDs properly for multiple buffs with the same name. Feel free to make a pull request i guess!
